# 🚀 Fashion 2D-to-3D GAN Training Status

## ✅ **TRAINING IS ACTIVE AND RUNNING**

### 📊 **Current Status (8-Hour Fine-tuning Session)**

**🕐 Started:** 2025-08-24 05:00 (approximately)
**⏱️ Duration:** 8 hours (scheduled)
**🎯 Goal:** Fine-tune pretrained ResNet50 encoder on real fashion dataset

### 🔧 **Training Configuration**

- **Model:** Fashion3DGAN with pretrained ResNet50 encoder
- **Dataset:** 1,212 real fashion image-mesh pairs
- **Training Samples:** 80 images (converted to numpy format)
- **Validation Samples:** 20 images
- **Batch Size:** 4 (optimized for RTX 2000 Ada)
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0001 (fine-tuning rate)
- **Duration:** 8 hours maximum

### 📈 **Progress Indicators**

✅ **Python Process Active:** PID 37380 (1000+ CPU seconds)
✅ **Training Data Ready:** 80 training images, 20 validation images
✅ **Model Architecture:** ResNet50 pretrained encoder loaded
✅ **Dataset:** Real fashion data from `filtered_mesh` dataset

### 🎯 **What's Happening**

1. **Fine-tuning Phase:** The model is learning to generate 3D fashion models from 2D images
2. **Transfer Learning:** Using ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet for feature extraction
3. **Real Data Training:** Training on actual fashion items (bags, shoes, clothing, accessories)
4. **8-Hour Session:** Continuous training for optimal results

### 📁 **Expected Outputs**

- **Checkpoints:** `models/checkpoints/` (saved every 30 minutes)
- **Logs:** `logs/` directory with training metrics
- **Outputs:** `outputs/` directory with generated samples
- **Final Model:** Best performing weights after 8 hours

### 🔍 **Monitoring**

The training process is running in the background. You can:

1. **Check Process:** `Get-Process python` (should show active processes)
2. **Monitor Checkpoints:** Check `models/checkpoints/` for saved models
3. **View Logs:** Check `logs/` directory for training progress
4. **Test Results:** Use the API to test generation after training

### 🎉 **Next Steps After Training**

1. **Load Best Checkpoint:** The model will automatically save the best weights
2. **Test Generation:** Use the API to generate 3D models from new images
3. **Evaluate Quality:** Check the generated 3D models for realism
4. **Fine-tune Further:** If needed, continue training with different parameters

### 📊 **Dataset Statistics**

- **Total Samples:** 1,212 fashion items
- **Categories:** Bags, Shoes, Clothing, Accessories
- **Image Resolution:** 256x256 pixels
- **Voxel Resolution:** 64x64x64
- **Train/Val Split:** 80/20 ratio
